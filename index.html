    <p>Ever since I was a young boy I have had a keen interest in gaming. I began playing video games around the age of six while I lived in Mexico. I vividly remember the distinct start up noise of the Playstation 2 my friends had and the countless crazy memories we made together on GTA San Andreas. Wether it be on family's old computer, a mobile phone, or whatever console I had managed to get my hands on video games played a large role in my childhood. Video games have given me so many good memories over the years and so I want to spread that joy to as many others as possible.</p>
    <p>We sell all variety of video games and video game related items. We have all sorts of consoles from old to new. We also sell PC's, monitors, gaming headphones, chairs, mouse & keyboards, and controllers. We provide all of these products at an affordable price unlike most other stores which are similar to this one (Gamestop, BestBuy, etc). We also offer a repair service in which customers can bring in any malfunctioning equipment and have it repaired free of cost (if a warranty was purchased). If we do not have a particular item available when you visit then we can order it and ship it to your house.</p>
