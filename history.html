                <p>Our story begins with me, my girlfriend, and some of our very close friends discussing our aspirations in life. We were fresh out of high school and did not think that going to college was the right move for us. Video games had been a major part of all our lives so we were brainstorming ideas that had any relation to them. Our first succesful business idea was a simple video game store where games were our only product. We continued with only selling games from 2010-2013 when we then decided to diversify our products. We began carrying gaming consoles, controllers, and other similar equipment from 2013-2015. Our final and most recent change occured in 2017 when we began offering a repair service where people could bring in faulty items and have them repaired free of charge (assuming a warranty was purchased). We also began to have the option to ship products directly to the consumers from 2017 onwards.</p>
